# Login_Page-Java
Created using Eclipse IDE with Windows Builder and MySQL plugin
Whenever extra windows are created program will crash unexpectedly, therefore, Forgot Password and Register User functions are kept on the single window with Login. SQL exception will be thrown whenever Forgot Password functionality is run, however, the program will successfully update the password in the SQL database regardless. MySQL database connector file is included within this repository to ensure connection from Eclipse to MySQL. The Windows Builder plugin or some version of JFrame may be needed to ensure compatibility with other Eclipse IDE's.
